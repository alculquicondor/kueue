# Queued Workload

A _queued workload_ (or simply _workload_) is an application that will run to
completion. It can be composed by one or multiple Pods that, loosely or tightly
coupled, that, as a whole, complete a task. A workload is the unit of [admission](.#admission)
in Kueue.

The prototypical workload can be represented with a
[Kubernetes `v1/batch.Job`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/).
For this reason, we sometimes use the word _job_ to refer to any workload, and
`Job` when we refer specifically to the Kubernetes API.

However, Kueue does not directly manipulate Job objects. Instead, Kueue
manages QueuedWorkload objects that represent the resource requirements
of an arbitrary workload. Kueue automatically creates a QueuedWorkload for
each Job object and syncs the decisions and statuses.

The manifest for a QueuedWorkload looks like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: QueuedWorkload
metadata:
  name: sample-job
  namespace: default
spec:
  pods:
  - count: 3
    name: main
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/k8s-staging-perf-tests/sleep:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: container
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: 200Mi
      restartPolicy: Never
  queueName: user-queue
```

## Pod sets

A QueuedWorkload represents a workload composed of multiple Pods with different
pod specs.

Each item of the `.spec.pods` list represents a set of homogeneous Pods and has
the following fields:
- `spec` describes the pods using a [`v1/core.PodSpec`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#PodSpec).
- `count` is the number of pods that use the same `spec`.
- `name` is a human-readable identifier for the group of pods. You can use the
  role of the Pods in the workload, like `driver`, `worker`, `parameter-server`, etc.

## Custom workloads

As described previously, Kueue has built-in support for workloads created with
the Job API. But any custom workload API can integrate with Kueue by
creating a corresponding `QueuedWorkload` object for it.
